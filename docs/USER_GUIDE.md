## What is CFV?

**Crypto Fair Value (CFV)** is a system that calculates the "fair" or intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies based on the Digital Gold Standard formula from "Perfect Money" by John Gotts.

### Key Benefits

- 💰 **Save Money** - Get discounts up to 10% when paying with undervalued cryptocurrencies
- 📊 **Fair Pricing** - Prices based on fundamental value, not just market speculation
- 🔒 **Transparent** - All calculations are based on objective metrics
- 🌍 **12 Supported Coins** - Choose from a variety of payment options

## How CFV Discounts Work

The system automatically calculates discounts based on how undervalued a cryptocurrency is compared to its fair value.

### Discount Tiers

| Undervaluation | Your Discount | Example |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **≥ 50%** | **10%** | Pay $90 for $100 order |
| **30-49%** | **7%** | Pay $93 for $100 order |
| **15-29%** | **5%** | Pay $95 for $100 order |
| **< 15%** | **2%** | Pay $98 for $100 order |
| **Overvalued** | **0%** | Pay full $100 |

### Example Calculation

Let's say you want to buy a product for $100:

1. **Current Market Price** of XNO: $1.00
2. **CFV Fair Value** of XNO: $1.65
3. **Undervaluation**: 65% (highly undervalued!)
4. **Your Discount**: 10% (highest tier)
5. **You Pay**: $90 instead of $100
6. **Amount in XNO**: 90 XNO

**You save $10!** 🎉

## Understanding Valuations

### Valuation Status

**🟢 Undervalued**
- Fair value is higher than market price
- Good time to use for payments
- Receive CFV discount

**🟡 Fair**
- Fair value matches market price
- Minimal or no discount
- Fair price for both parties

**🔴 Overvalued**
- Fair value is lower than market price
- No discount applied
- Consider using a different coin

### How Fair Value is Calculated

CFV uses the Digital Gold Standard formula which considers:

1. **Network Security** - Hash rate, node distribution
2. **Utility Value** - Real-world use cases
3. **Scarcity** - Supply metrics and tokenomics
4. **Adoption** - Active addresses, transaction volume
5. **Development** - Code commits, developer activity

This provides a more accurate value than speculation-driven market prices.
